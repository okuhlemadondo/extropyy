excerpt: "The notion that a single group could orchestrate the vast tapestry of human society oversimplifies history’s complexity. Power, woven through biology and survival, defies such tidy explanations. To unravel these threads is to confront a truth far messier than any one narrative can hold."

The question "Who set that system up?" often surfaces in discussions about "the patriarchy," particularly from those wielding it as a rhetorical cudgel—frequently with a tinge of misandry—to imply that men, as a monolithic group, deliberately engineered society to oppress women. This question is not only misleading but also reductive, rooted in a childishly simplistic view of reality that assumes complex social systems can be traced to a single architect with malicious intent. Below, I offer a thorough rebuttal, dismantling the question’s assumptions with historical, biological, and sociological evidence, while also addressing the broader futility of overanalyzing or debating such concepts when they are framed in such oversimplified terms.

The question presupposes that "the patriarchy" is a singular, intentionally constructed system, akin to a machine with a blueprint labeled "Male Oppression." This is a strawman of epic proportions. Social systems, including gender norms, are not the product of a single mind or conspiracy but the result of millennia of decentralized human interactions, shaped by survival needs, biology, and culture. To ask "who set it up?" is to misunderstand how societies evolve, akin to demanding the name of the person who invented language.

Historically, early human societies were driven by pragmatic necessities. Physical strength, more prevalent in men due to biological factors like testosterone and muscle mass, dictated roles in hunting, combat, and construction—tasks critical to group survival. These roles were not assigned by a committee of men plotting to subjugate women but emerged organically from environmental pressures. Over time, these divisions calcified into norms, laws, and institutions, not through malice but through adaptation. The question ignores this complexity, assuming a level of intent and coordination that simply did not exist. It’s a simplistic lens that distorts history into a narrative of deliberate oppression, conveniently sidestepping the messy reality of human progress.

The notion that men alone crafted "the patriarchy" erases the agency of women, who have historically played significant roles in shaping and reinforcing gender norms. From mothers teaching daughters to prioritize family to women upholding social standards through gossip or rewarding compliance, women have been active participants in cultural systems—not merely passive victims. This is not to blame women but to acknowledge reality: humans, regardless of sex, perpetuate the norms they inherit.

Consider historical practices like foot-binding in China or arranged marriages in various cultures, often enforced by women who believed these traditions preserved social order or status. Even today, studies, such as those from Pew Research (2015), reveal that women can be harsher critics of other women who deviate from traditional roles—working mothers or child-free women—than men are. By ignoring women’s influence, the question infantilizes them, stripping away their responsibility while painting men as the sole architects of culture. This selective narrative fuels division rather than understanding, relying on a binary that collapses under scrutiny.

The term "patriarchy" suggests men universally hold power over women, but this flattens the nuanced reality of power dynamics. Power has always been stratified by class, race, wealth, and circumstance, not merely gender. Most men, historically and today, have had little control over their lives, let alone society. The medieval serf, the conscripted soldier, or the factory worker was not exactly orchestrating systemic oppression. In feudal Europe, 90% of men were peasants with no political or economic agency, unable to vote or defy their lords—male or female. Today, men dominate both the highest echelons (CEOs, politicians) and the lowest rungs (homelessness, workplace fatalities) of society. For every male billionaire, thousands of men scrape by, far from any seat of power.

The question’s assumption of a unified "male agenda" ignores this stratification, lumping the average man with elites in a way that distorts reality. It’s a lazy generalization that vilifies all men while glossing over the mechanisms of power, which often transcend gender. This oversimplification serves only to inflame resentment, not to illuminate truth.

Gender roles were not arbitrary constructs but were heavily influenced by biological realities that only modern technology has mitigated. Pregnancy, childbirth, and nursing tied women to domestic roles for centuries—not by male decree but by necessity. Men, being biologically expendable (one man could father many children, but one woman’s death reduced reproductive capacity), took on high-risk roles like war, hunting, or exploration. This wasn’t oppression; it was survival math, rooted in the reproductive constraints of pre-industrial life.

Anthropological data, such as Murdock’s Ethnographic Atlas, shows that most pre-industrial societies divided labor by sex, with men hunting and women gathering or caregiving. These patterns held across cultures not because of a global male conspiracy but because they aligned with biological imperatives. The question sidesteps this, pretending gender norms were purely cultural or malicious. To judge ancient systems by today’s standards, where contraception and automation have leveled the playing field, is intellectually dishonest and ignores the constraints under which humanity operated for millennia.

If "the patriarchy" exists, it has never been a one-way street of male privilege. Men faced rigid expectations—to provide, protect, and sacrifice, often at the cost of their lives. Failure meant shame, exile, or death. While women’s historical struggles, such as limited legal rights, are undeniable, men’s burdens were equally severe. They were conscripted into wars, worked deadly jobs, and faced relentless pressure to prioritize others’ survival over their own.

Data underscores this: men accounted for 97% of U.S. workplace deaths in 2020 (Bureau of Labor Statistics), a trend consistent with historical patterns of male labor in hazardous roles. Men also die younger, historically and today, due to war, work, and social pressures, and are three to four times more likely to die by suicide (CDC, 2021). These are not privileges but burdens tied to male roles within so-called patriarchal systems. The question’s assumption that men universally benefited ignores these realities, perpetuating a narrative of male guilt that erases male suffering and distorts the broader picture.

In today’s West, any remnants of "patriarchy" are a patchwork, not a monolith. Women vote, own property, lead companies, and outpace men in education—earning 58% of U.S. bachelor’s degrees (NCES, 2022). Yet men still dominate fields like STEM or politics, driven by a mix of individual choice, aptitude, and lingering norms. Meanwhile, men face systemic disadvantages, such as harsher prison sentences for identical crimes (Yale Law Journal, 2012) or bias in family courts, where mothers receive custody in 80% of cases (Census Bureau, 2018).

The question’s focus on a supposed male-orchestrated system ignores this fluidity. Modern power dynamics reflect inertia, cultural habits, and individual decisions as much as any grand design. Clinging to "patriarchy" as a catch-all explanation dismisses both women’s progress and men’s challenges, keeping discourse trapped in an outdated framework that no longer fully applies.

Beyond its factual flaws, the question "Who set that system up?" reveals a deeper issue: the futility of overanalyzing or debating concepts like "the patriarchy" when they’re grounded in a childishly simplistic view of reality. The term itself is often wielded as a blunt instrument, reducing centuries of human history to a single, gendered villain. This approach assumes society can be neatly dissected into oppressors and oppressed, ignoring the interplay of biology, culture, economics, and chance. It’s a mindset that seeks scapegoats rather than solutions, turning complex systems into morality plays.

Such debates devolve into rhetorical traps, where the goal is not understanding but point-scoring. The question doesn’t invite dialogue; it demands a culprit, shutting down nuance in favor of outrage. This is particularly evident when misandrists deploy it to vilify men as a class, ignoring women’s agency, men’s struggles, and the shared human condition. Overanalyzing "the patriarchy" in these terms wastes energy on blame rather than addressing tangible issues—like wage gaps in specific industries or mental health disparities—which require data-driven, collaborative solutions, not ideological crusades.

The futility lies in the disconnect between the question’s premise and reality’s complexity. Social systems are not "set up" like board games; they emerge, evolve, and fracture over time. To debate them as if they have a single origin or orchestrator is to chase shadows, expending intellectual capital on a framework too simplistic to yield meaningful answers. Progress demands moving beyond such childish binaries to grapple with the world as it is: messy, multifaceted, and resistant to easy labels.

The question "Who set that system up?" is a flawed and misleading attempt to pin the complexities of gender norms on a single group—men—while ignoring biology, history, and shared human agency. It assumes a deliberate, malevolent design where none existed, erasing women’s influence, men’s burdens, and the stratified nature of power. By demanding a scapegoat, it fuels division rather than understanding, perpetuating a narrative that vilifies one sex while infantilizing the other.

Moreover, the obsession with debating "the patriarchy" in such simplistic terms is a futile exercise, rooted in a view of reality that flattens nuance into caricature. Social systems are not conspiracies to be unraveled but emergent phenomena to be studied with rigor and humility. To move forward, we must abandon gotchas like this question and focus on concrete problems with clear-eyed analysis. Anything less is just noise—divisive, distracting, and ultimately pointless.
