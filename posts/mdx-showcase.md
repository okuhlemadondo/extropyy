# MDX Showcase: Rich Content in Action

This article demonstrates the various rich formatting features available through MDX, including LaTeX mathematics, syntax highlighting, and embedded media.

## LaTeX Equations

MDX supports both inline and block LaTeX equations. Here's an example of an inline equation: $E = mc^2$, which is Einstein's famous equation.

And here's a block equation:

$$
\frac{\partial f}{\partial t} + \vec{v} \cdot \nabla f = 0
$$

This is the transport equation in physics. We can also write more complex equations:

$$
\begin{align}
\nabla \times \vec{E} &= -\frac{\partial \vec{B}}{\partial t} \\
\nabla \times \vec{B} &= \mu_0 \vec{J} + \mu_0\epsilon_0\frac{\partial \vec{E}}{\partial t}
\end{align}
$$

These are two of Maxwell's equations in differential form.

## Code Syntax Highlighting

MDX supports syntax highlighting for code blocks:

```javascript
function fibonacci(n) {
  if (n <= 1) return n;
  return fibonacci(n - 1) + fibonacci(n - 2);
}

console.log(fibonacci(10)); // Outputs: 55
```

Python example:

```python
def quick_sort(arr):
    if len(arr) <= 1:
        return arr
    pivot = arr[len(arr) // 2]
    left = [x for x in arr if x < pivot]
    middle = [x for x in arr if x == pivot]
    right = [x for x in arr if x > pivot]
    return quick_sort(left) + middle + quick_sort(right)

print(quick_sort([3, 6, 8, 10, 1, 2, 1]))
```

## Embedded Media

## Rich Text Formatting

MDX also supports all standard Markdown formatting:

### Lists

- Item 1
- Item 2
  - Nested item A
  - Nested item B
- Item 3

### Tables

| Name     | Age | Occupation      |
|----------|-----|-----------------|
| John     | 35  | Software Engineer |
| Sarah    | 29  | Data Scientist  |
| Michael  | 42  | Product Manager |

### Blockquotes

> The future belongs to those who believe in the beauty of their dreams.
> â€” Eleanor Roosevelt

## Conclusion

MDX provides a powerful way to create rich content that combines the simplicity of Markdown with the expressiveness of JSX components. This makes it perfect for technical blogs, documentation sites, and any content that requires more than just basic text formatting.
